In the paper, two scene point cloud datasets are generated based on the same industrial scene. One is used to train the point cloud generation network, which is called the generation dataset. And the other is used to train the entire prior information-assisted segmentation network, which is called the segmentation dataset. The files for these two datasets are located in their respective folders.
